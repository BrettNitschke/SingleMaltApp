# SingleMaltApp
An App I made for fun - still in progress.  Saves info on various whiskies I have tried


The user selects add new single malt.  they add basic info there, and can upload a picture

to edit, you touch the single malt in the table view.  from there, you can add a new picture and update the grade as well as 
other attributes.  more features to be added soon.

the number grade is reflected with a letter grade image on the tableview page
